	<p>Sweet Instrumental Music are what i appreciate the most. Whenever I am stressed I always listen to this kind of music to keep me calm. 
	It can also increase focus. Several studies show that students who listen to music while completing tasks such as reading and writing tend 
	to be less efficient, and don't absorb much information compared to those who don't listen to music. In addition, loud or 'angry' music has negative effects on reading comprehension, as well as mood.
	So whenever I am reviewing I make sure I listen to it because I know I can concentrate. Instrumental Music doesnâ€™t just motivate you. It can also help reduce stress and promote a more positive mindset.

	<p>Paris is beautiful city of lights, parks, world famous buildings and monuments, fashion, cuisine, wonderful language, Haussman architecture lining wide avenues.
	This is similar to one of the video clips I have seen in the series <i>Emily in Paris</i> starring my favorite actress Lily Collins. This was one of my favorite series to watch last year during lockdown.</p><br>
