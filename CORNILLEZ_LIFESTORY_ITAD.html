		<blockquote><blockquote><p style="font-family: 'Yusei Magic', sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My childhood years were both fun and memorable for me. <sup>1</sup> At an early age, my parents taught me values in life that I still carry until now. 
		<sup>2</sup> There was never a time that they never told me stories from my favorite book and some Bible stories before I go to bed. <sup>3</sup> My mama told me that I started to learn walking when I was 11 months old only. 
		<sup>4</sup> I entered school when I was 4 years old at <b>Rogerian Learning Center</b>. <sup>5</sup> And, when I was in gradeschool, I entered an all-girls school in Quezon City – <b>St. Theresa’s College</b>. 
		<sup>6</sup> I was there for 6 years, I met a lot of nice friends, but there were also bullies. <sup>7</sup> I just miss the big cafeteria and lawn in our school, where I could just play and run like carefree child. 
		<sup>8</sup> Fieldtrips where the best during gradeschool. <sup>9</sup> We went to zoos, product factories, museums, and places like, Pampanga and Zambales. 
		<sup>10</sup> While I was having fun, my parents were a bit worried while on a trip because I was still young, we were not allowed to have guardians. <sup>11</sup> They make sure that the snack, food, and drinks I bring are complete before I leave. 
		<sup>12</sup> I also experienced having an exposure trip when I was in 6th grade. <sup>13</sup> It is where we visit different barangays near our school, and we donate goods that our club collected.
		<sup>14</sup> I remember playing <i>bahay-bahayan</i> and <i>luto-lutuan</i> with my cousins everyday after school. <sup>15</sup> We often also played Nintendo during weekends and my mama would prepare merienda for us. 
		<sup>16</sup> I also remember during Sundays, after going to church, we used to go to the mall to play in arcades and playhouses. <sup>17</sup> My parents would usually let me and my younger sister play for an hour. 
		<sup>18</sup> We met a lot of kids and played different toys there.<sup>19</sup> It was just so fun to remember!
		<sup>20</sup> I am grateful for my parents because they did not introduce technology to me at a young age.</blockquote></blockquote><br>

		<sup>1</sup> I entered <b>The National Teacher’s College</b> when I was in junior Highschool.<sup>2</sup> I studied there because my mom was studying her second degree in the said school.
		<sup>3</sup> During our first day, I felt awkward to the people around me since I am not used to have boys inside the room. <sup>4</sup> Unfortunately, my first friend was a guy.
		<sup>5</sup> And I made a lot of friends in our room as day goes by. <sup>6</sup> At the age of 13, I started to go out with my friends, who are also my groupmates, for our group project. 
		<sup>7</sup> It was my first time to ask permission from my mama and I was really scared because she and Papa never let me go out with friends because I am still young.<sup>8</sup> But my two friends insisted that they will bring me home because they know that I am not fond of commuting around Manila.
		<sup>9</sup> To my surprise, my mama allowed me to go out but asked a lot of things before doing so.<sup>10</sup> During this year, I also got closer to my parents. I even tell them my happy crushes and problems I have.  
		<sup>11</sup> When I was in 8th grade, I got separated from our block section and was transferred to the star section.<sup>12</sup> I got nervous because I was the only one transferred in our circle but made friends again during that day. 
		<sup>13</sup> I also experienced promenade during Highschool in Manila Hotel.<sup>14</sup> I had so much fun during that day because I was dressed up like what I see on movies.
		<sup>15</sup> Intramurals was also one of the most unforgettable. <sup>16</sup> There were a lot of booths inside our school and no classes for one week.
		<sup>17</sup> When I graduated junior high school, I decided to study Senior Highschool in <b>University of the East</b>.<sup>18</sup> I was in awe when I entered the campus because I wanted to study in a university.
		<sup>19</sup> I learned a lot from my <abbr title="Senior Highschool">SHS days</abbr>, not just the lessons form modules but values as well.<sup>20</sup> There are also professors who I still have contact with until now and became friends and mentors.
		<sup>21</sup> I graduated both Junior Highschool in <abbr title="The National Teacher’s College">NTC</abbr> and Senior Highschool in <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr>, with honors.</blockquote></blockquote><br>

		<sup>2</sup> I felt nervous during my first day because I remember my cousin telling me that college is not easy.<sup>3</sup> New faces inside the room!
		<sup>4</sup> And yes, I met new friends from different schools in our block.<sup>5</sup> During my first year I really had a hard time in my course already because I came from the strand STEM when I was in Senior High.
		<sup>6</sup> What I learned in that course was way different from what I encountered when I was in first year.<sup>7</sup> It was really confusing, and I doubted myself many times because I thought my course was not for me.
		<sup>8</sup> I studied hard to prove myself and my parents that I was on the right track.<sup>9</sup> Until I finished first semester of first year and was grant with <i>College Scholarship</i>. 
		<sup>10</sup> I was not expecting it but all my hardwork were paid off.<sup>11</sup> I also remembered experiencing a trip to Bulacan for our history class last February 2020, before the pandemic happened.
		<sup>12</sup> I had so much fun with my blockmates and friends during that time.<sup>13</sup> During our 2nd year, pandemic is already present.
		<sup>14</sup> It was the toughest semester and school year for me because I got anxious all the time.<sup>15</sup> I had a difficult time with the connection, using my device, communicating during group works, doing house chores etc.
		<sup>16</sup> My parents kept reminding me that I can do it, and to enjoy what I do and avoid pressuring myself despite all.<sup>17</sup> I missed going out with my family to the beach every Christmas or Semestral break to relax and bond with the family.
		<sup>18</sup> I also miss going out with friends especially when we feel like we need to take a rest and just go somewhere else to ease the stress. <sup>19</sup> Now we could not do it. 
		<sup>20</sup> It was indeed hard to manage stress during this tough times.<sup>21</sup> All we can do is to stay home, pray and follow the safety protocols, to be safe and not get infected by the virus. 
		<sup>22</sup> It is the help we can contribute to our heroes – the <b><em>frontliners</em><b>.</blockquote></blockquote>
