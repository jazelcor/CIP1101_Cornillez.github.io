				<li type ="disc"><b>Reply 1988</b></li>
				<p><blockquote>
					Reply 1988 revolves around the lives of a group of five friends in Ssangmun-dong, a small neighborhood in Seoul.  The story starts in 1988, covers 1989, and fast-forwards to 1994 and 1995. The series is a wonderful depiction of friendship, family, and first loves. It shows the ups, downs, and total 180s that Koreans in Seoul have experienced in the late '80s and early '90s. The five lifelong friends may be the official lead characters, but their moms, dads, and siblings are each like a bida in their own right, too.

				<li type ="disc"><b>Phineas and Ferb</b></li>
				<p><blockquote>Phineas and Ferb is an American animated musical comedy television series in Disney Channel. It’s my favorite television show of all time. I can watch a show from the first season in 2008 and still be able to sing along with all of the songs as if it had just aired for the first time. I have been watching the “Last Days of Summer” marathon on Disney X D for nearly four days in advance of tonight’s series finale. Such an extensive binge session not only makes one nostalgic for the magic of a simpler time, but also affords the viewer an opportunity to pick up on what made the show so special to begin with.</blockquote></p><br>

				<li type ="disc"><b>Tangled</b></li>
				<p><blockquote>Disney animation of a classic tale. Beautiful princess Rapunzel has been locked away in a tower since she was captured as a baby by an old hag. Her magical long blonde hair has the power to provide eternal youth, and the evil Gothel uses this power to keep her young. At the age of 18, Rapunzel becomes curious about the outside world, and when a prince uses her tower as a refuge, she asks him to help her escape.<br>

				<li type ="disc"><b>A Walk To Remember</b></li>
				<p><blockquote>A Walk to Remember is a 2002 American coming-of-age romantic drama film directed by Adam Shankman and written by Karen Janszen, based on Nicholas Sparks' 1999 novel. Life is always is a miracle. That was the lesson I learned in this movie.
					When Landon was reading Jamie's profile in their year book, it was stated there that her ambition is to witness a miracle. All along he thought that her miracle would be her being cured from her illness. This is one of my favorites and will always be.</blockquote></p><br>
