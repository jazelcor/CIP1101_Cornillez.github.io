	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:100px;;margin-right:900px;">Are terraces that 
	were carved into the mountains of Banaue, Ifugao, in the Philippines, by the ancestors 
	of the indigenous people. The terraces are occasionally called the "Eighth Wonder of the 
	World". It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, 
	largely by hand.</p>

	<h2 style="font-family:Georgia;margin-left:300px;">Directions</h2>
	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:100px;;margin-right:900px;">There is only one 
	way to reach the Banaue Rice Terraces location and it is by bus. From Cubao or Sampaloc 
	in Manila, you can ride a bus bound for Banaue. There are two buses that go straight to 
	Banaue: Coda Lines and Ohayami Trans. The travel time will take about 9 hours at the 
	minimum.  Upon arrival in Banaue bus terminal, you can ride a tricycle going to your 
	hotel or just tour the area directly. The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras 
	embody the absolute blending of the physical, socio-cultural, economic, and religious 
	environment. Indeed, it is a living cultural landscape of exceptional beauty.</p>
